Requirements :
	<script src="js/react.min.js"></script> - react js minified file. (you must use minified version because it will have issue on live if it is not minified)
    <script src="js/react-dom.min.js"></script> - react dom js minified file. (you must use minified version because it will have issue on live if it is not minified)
    <script src="js/browser.min.js"></script> - jsX converter into javascript file.

 FAQs :
 	The script is written on jsX(javascript XML) so we need to use babel to convert it into native javascript file so that the browser will read it.
 	If you don't want to use the browser.min.js(converter) on your system, you may convert to code directly from jsX into js. Just go into the link
